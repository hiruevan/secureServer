# secureServer
This is a new project I have started working on, and explores secure-safe programming. It is a python web-app server with all the best security practices written in python, JS, HTML, CSS, and C#.

Note that the current version (v5.1) has passed basic security practice checks, however not any real penetration testing. Also note that this is designed to work on windows, (specifically 11, though it should function on 10) and will be migrated to linux in later versions.

The code provided in main.py and all the frontend is a example use of this system for a wepapp "Secure Vault". Feel free to edit that and make your own, but note that the primary purpose of this project is focused on making a system that is easy to create secure python webapps.
